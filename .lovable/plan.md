# Smart Energy Pay — Premium Landing Page

## Design Direction
A **dark-themed, futuristic green-tech aesthetic** inspired by the reference images — deep dark backgrounds (near-black/dark charcoal), glowing emerald green accents, subtle gradients, and a premium fintech feel. The Smart Energy Pay logo will be prominently displayed in the header alongside the business name.

## Logo & Branding

- Green glow effects and emerald accent colors throughout to match the logo's aesthetic
